# 📡 Exposing Your Serverless Application with API Gateway and Cognito

In our serverless journey so far, we've learned how to **store data in DynamoDB**. Now, it's time to **open our application to the world** by providing access through a **REST API** — without managing any servers!

## 🌐 Introducing API Gateway

**Amazon API Gateway** is the service we’ll use to:
- **Expose our serverless functions** (such as AWS Lambda) to the outside world.
- **Create RESTful APIs** without worrying about infrastructure management.
- **Handle routing, security, and scalability** out of the box.

With API Gateway, you can seamlessly **publish, maintain, monitor, and secure** APIs at any scale.

## 🔒 Securing APIs with Amazon Cognito

Simply exposing an API isn't enough — we must also **protect** it.  
This is where **Amazon Cognito** comes in:
- Provides **user authentication and authorization**.
- Manages **user sign-up, sign-in, and access control**.
- Easily integrates with **API Gateway** to restrict access to authenticated users only.

Using Cognito ensures that only legitimate users can interact with your API.

## 🏗️ What You'll Learn in This Section

- **Deploy a REST API** using **API Gateway** on top of your serverless application.
- **Secure your API** using **Amazon Cognito**.
- **Connect all components together**, allowing users to access your cloud application securely.

**Next Steps:**  
➡️ We'll start by setting up API Gateway to expose our serverless backend, and then configure Cognito for user authentication!
