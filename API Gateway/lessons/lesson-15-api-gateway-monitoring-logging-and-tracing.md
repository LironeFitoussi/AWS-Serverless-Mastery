# **Monitoring, Logging, and Tracing in API Gateway**

Monitoring your APIs with **AWS API Gateway** ensures that you can **troubleshoot**, **optimize performance**, and **improve reliability**. In this guide, we cover key aspects of **logging**, **tracing**, and **metrics** for API Gateway.

---

## **CloudWatch Logging**

- **Purpose**: Capture detailed information about **requests** and **responses** passing through API Gateway.

- **How It Works**:
  - Logs are **enabled at the stage level**.
  - You can define the **Log Level**:
    - **ERROR**: Only log error-level events.
    - **INFO**: General operational information.
    - **DEBUG**: Highly detailed logs, including request and response bodies.

- **Flow**:
  - **Client** sends a request ➔ **API Gateway** logs the request ➔ forwards it to **backend** ➔ backend responds ➔ **API Gateway** logs the response ➔ sends the response to **client**.

- **Security Note**:  
  - Logging can capture **sensitive information**, so use **carefully in production** environments.

## **X-Ray Tracing**

- **Purpose**:  
  **AWS X-Ray** provides **end-to-end tracing** for requests passing through API Gateway.

- **Benefit**:
  - If you enable X-Ray for both **API Gateway** and **Lambda**, you can trace the **entire path** of a request from the API layer down to backend processing.

## **CloudWatch Metrics for API Gateway**

- **Metrics are collected per stage**.
- **Detailed Metrics** can be enabled for additional granularity.

### **Important Metrics**:

| **Metric Name**         | **Description** |
|--------------------------|------------------|
| **CacheHitCount**         | Number of requests served from the **cache**. |
| **CacheMissCount**        | Number of requests **not served** from the cache (requiring backend call). |
| **Count**                 | Total number of API requests over a period. |
| **IntegrationLatency**    | Time taken by the backend to respond **after API Gateway forwards the request**. |
| **Latency**               | Total time from **API Gateway receiving a request** to **sending a response**, including backend, authentication, caching, and mapping templates. |
| **4XXError**              | Number of **client-side errors** (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 429 Too Many Requests). |
| **5XXError**              | Number of **server-side errors** (e.g., 502 Bad Gateway, 503 Service Unavailable, 504 Gateway Timeout). |

---

## **Latency and Timeout**

- **Maximum time** an API Gateway request can last: **29 seconds**.
- If **IntegrationLatency** or **Latency** exceeds 29 seconds:
  - API Gateway returns a **504 Gateway Timeout** error.

---

## **Throttling in API Gateway**

- **Default Soft Limit**:  
  - **10,000 requests per second** across all APIs in your account.
  - Limit is **shared** across APIs and can be **increased** upon request.

- **429 Too Many Requests**:
  - Occurs when a client exceeds the allowed rate.
  - Clients should use **exponential backoff** strategies for retries.

- **Best Practices**:
  - Set **stage-level** and **method-level throttling limits** to prevent one API from consuming all request capacity.
  - Use **usage plans** to enforce **per-customer throttling and quotas**.

## **API Gateway Error Codes Summary**

| **Error Code** | **Category**         | **Meaning** |
|----------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| **400**        | Client Error           | Bad Request (malformed input). |
| **429**        | Client Error           | Too Many Requests (throttling). |
| **502**        | Server Error           | Bad Gateway (backend did not respond properly). |
| **503**        | Server Error           | Service Unavailable (backend down). |
| **504**        | Server Error           | Gateway Timeout (no response within 29 seconds). |

# **Conclusion**

Properly configuring **logging**, **tracing**, and **monitoring** in **API Gateway** is essential for **operational visibility** and **issue diagnosis**.  
By leveraging **CloudWatch Logs**, **CloudWatch Metrics**, and **X-Ray Tracing**, you can gain a complete view of your API's health and performance, making your services more **resilient** and **scalable**.
