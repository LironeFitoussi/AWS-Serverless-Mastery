# **Managing Deployments and Stages in AWS API Gateway**

When working with **AWS API Gateway**, understanding how **deployments** and **stages** operate is crucial for smooth API versioning and updates. This article breaks down the key concepts, best practices, and common patterns to manage deployments effectively.

## **The Importance of Deployment**

- **Deployment Requirement:**  
  Changes made to an API in API Gateway are **not live** until a **deployment** is performed.
  
- **Common Pitfall:**  
  Forgetting to deploy after making changes can leave the live API **outdated** or **incorrect**.

- **Deployment to Stages:**  
  Changes are deployed to specific **stages**.  
  - You can have **multiple stages** (e.g., `dev`, `test`, `prod`, or `v1`, `v2`, `v3`).
  - Each stage **retains its own configuration** and has a full **deployment history** for easy rollbacks.

## **Handling API Versions with Stages**

When making **breaking changes** to the backend (such as modifying the structure of a **Lambda function**):

- **Versioning Example:**
  - `v1` Stage → Deployed with the `v1` Lambda function.  
  - Create a new `v2` Stage → Deployed with the updated `v2` Lambda function.

- **Benefits:**
  - Each stage (e.g., `/v1`, `/v2`) gets a **unique URL** (e.g., `api.example.com/v2`).
  - Clients can **migrate** at their own pace from `v1` to `v2`.
  - Both versions can **coexist** until migration is complete, ensuring **backward compatibility**.

## **Stage Variables: Dynamic Configuration Without Redeployment**

**Stage Variables** are like **environment variables** for API Gateway stages, enabling dynamic behavior without the need for redeployment.

- **Use Cases:**
  - Specify the **Lambda function ARN** dynamically.
  - Configure **HTTP endpoints** and **mapping templates**.
  - Pass configuration values to Lambda functions.

- **Accessing Stage Variables:**
  - Syntax:  
    ```
    $stageVariables.variableName
    ```

- **Lambda Integration:**
  - Stage variables are passed to the **context object** within the Lambda function, making them easily accessible for logging or configuration.

## **Practical Example: Managing Lambda Versions with Stage Variables**

A typical pattern is to use stage variables to point to **Lambda aliases**, allowing seamless traffic management:

| **Stage** | **Alias** | **Lambda Version** |
|:---------|:----------|:------------------|
| dev      | dev alias | Latest version    |
| test     | test alias| v2 version         |
| prod     | prod alias| 95% to v1, 5% to v2 |

- **Lambda Aliases** manage **traffic shifting** between versions without updating API Gateway configurations.
- **Stage Variables** ensure that each stage calls the correct Lambda alias automatically.

# **Summary**

Understanding **deployments**, **stages**, and **stage variables** in AWS API Gateway allows developers to:
- Deploy and version APIs cleanly.
- Avoid breaking live APIs during updates.
- Dynamically adjust backend configurations without constant redeployment.
- Manage smooth client migrations between API versions.

This methodology is a **best practice** for building scalable, flexible, and resilient APIs in AWS.
