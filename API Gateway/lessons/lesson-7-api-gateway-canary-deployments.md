# **Implementing Canary Deployments in API Gateway**

In this lesson, we learn about **canary deployments** in **API Gateway** — a method to gradually roll out changes to a production API by shifting a small percentage of user traffic to the new version before a full release.

## **What is a Canary Deployment?**

A **canary deployment** allows you to:
- Route a **small percentage** of production traffic to a **new version** of your API or backend service.
- **Monitor** behavior, **analyze metrics**, **debug issues**, and **validate performance**.
- **Minimize risk** by ensuring that only a subset of users are impacted if something goes wrong.
- **Easily rollback** if issues are detected before full deployment.

## **Use Case Example**

- **Current Production Stage:**  
  Points to **Lambda version 1**.
- **Objective:**  
  Test **Lambda version 2** with minimal user exposure.
- **Strategy:**  
  - **95%** of traffic stays on the **existing stable version** (v1).
  - **5%** of traffic is routed to the **canary version** (v2).

---

## **Key Benefits**

- **Separate Metrics and Logs:**  
  Canary traffic generates its own logs and metrics, improving visibility and diagnostics.
  
- **Override Stage Variables:**  
  Customize configurations for canary traffic independently if needed.

- **Supports Blue/Green Deployment Patterns:**  
  Combine canary deployments with Lambda aliases to achieve robust release strategies.

## **Deployment Process**

1. **Configure the Canary Settings:**
   - Select the **production stage**.
   - Enable **canary deployments**.
   - Specify the **percentage of traffic** to shift to the canary version.

2. **Monitor and Analyze:**
   - Review canary-specific metrics and logs separately from main production traffic.
   - Validate system behavior before a full rollout.

3. **Promote or Rollback:**
   - **If successful:** Gradually move 100% of the traffic to the canary version.
   - **If issues detected:** Revert traffic back to the stable version immediately.

# **Summary**

**Canary deployments** in API Gateway are an essential tool for safely testing updates in production. They offer fine-grained control, advanced monitoring, and seamless rollback capabilities — ensuring higher confidence in your deployments while minimizing risks.
