# **Storing Data in a Serverless Architecture with DynamoDB**

When building **distributed** and **scalable** systems using **AWS Lambda**, one crucial question arises:  
**Where do we store our data?**

In serverless architectures, having a **serverless database** that scales effortlessly is essential. **DynamoDB** is the perfect solution for this need.

## **What is DynamoDB?**

- **DynamoDB** is a **fully managed**, **highly scalable**, and **serverless NoSQL database** provided by AWS.  
- It is designed to **seamlessly integrate** with AWS services like **AWS Lambda**, offering a powerful combination for building scalable applications.

## **Key Benefits of DynamoDB:**

- **Managed by AWS**: No need to worry about infrastructure management or scaling.
- **Automatic Scaling**: DynamoDB handles capacity automatically to meet your application's demands.
- **Native Integration**: Works incredibly well with **AWS Lambda** and other AWS tools.
- **High Availability**: Built-in replication across multiple availability zones ensures durability.

## **Focus Areas for Learning DynamoDB:**

In this section of the course, you will dive deep into:
- **Designing DynamoDB tables properly** to support efficient querying and performance.
- **Enabling DynamoDB Streams** to react to data changes in real-time.
- **Securing your DynamoDB tables** with the right permissions and best practices.
