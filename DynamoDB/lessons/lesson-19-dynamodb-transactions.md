# **Mastering DynamoDB Transactions**

## **What are DynamoDB Transactions?**
**DynamoDB Transactions** provide **all-or-nothing operations** across **multiple items** and **multiple tables**.  
This means that **either all the writes and updates succeed**, or **none of them are committed**, ensuring **strong consistency** and **reliable data integrity**.

Transactions in DynamoDB **bring full ACID properties**:
- **Atomicity**: All operations succeed or fail together.
- **Consistency**: Data remains consistent before and after the transaction.
- **Isolation**: Transactions are isolated from each other.
- **Durability**: Once committed, transactions persist even in the case of system failures.

# **Transaction Modes in DynamoDB**

## **Read Modes**
- **Eventual Consistency**: Default, may not reflect the latest changes.
- **Strong Consistency**: Guarantees the most up-to-date read.
- **Transactional Consistency**: Guarantees a **consistent view across multiple items and tables** within a transaction.

## **Write Modes**
- **Standard Writes**: Multiple writes; some can fail independently.
- **Transactional Writes**: **All writes succeed** or **all fail** together.

# **How DynamoDB Transactions Work**
When performing a transaction:
- **Write operations** consume **twice the normal WCU**.
- **Read operations** consume **twice the normal RCU**.
  
> ⚙️ This is because DynamoDB performs two steps internally: **prepare the transaction** and then **commit it**.

---

# **Key API Operations for Transactions**
- **`TransactGetItems`**: Retrieve one or more items **transactionally**.
- **`TransactWriteItems`**: Perform multiple **PutItem**, **UpdateItem**, or **DeleteItem** operations in **one atomic transaction**.

---

# **Use Cases for DynamoDB Transactions**
- **Financial transactions**: Moving money between accounts.
- **Order processing**: Reserving stock and placing an order simultaneously.
- **Multiplayer games**: Updating player states reliably.
- **Inventory management**: Coordinated updates across multiple records.

# **Example: Banking Application Scenario**

## **Tables:**
- **AccountBalance**:
  - `account_id` (Partition Key)
  - `balance`
  - `last_transaction_timestamp`
- **BankTransactions**:
  - `transaction_id` (Partition Key)
  - `transaction_timestamp`
  - `from_account`
  - `to_account`
  - `amount`

## **Transaction Workflow:**
- **UpdateItem**: Adjust balance in **AccountBalance**.
- **PutItem**: Record the transaction in **BankTransactions**.

✅ Either **both updates happen together** or **neither happens** — ensuring no partial operations in critical financial flows.

# **Capacity Computations for Transactions**

## **Transactional Writes**
**Example**:  
- **3 transactional writes per second**.
- **Item size**: 5 KB.

**Computation**:
```
3 (writes) × 5 KB (item size) ÷ 1 KB (WCU size) × 2 (for transaction overhead) = 30 WCUs
```
✅ You would need **30 Write Capacity Units**.

---

## **Transactional Reads**
**Example**:  
- **5 transactional reads per second**.
- **Item size**: 5 KB.

**Computation**:
- 5 KB rounds **up** to 8 KB (due to RCU 4KB rule).
```
5 (reads) × 8 KB (rounded size) ÷ 4 KB (RCU size) × 2 (for transaction overhead) = 20 RCUs
```
✅ You would need **20 Read Capacity Units**.

# **Summary**
DynamoDB Transactions bring true **ACID guarantees** to your NoSQL operations, critical for **financial apps**, **games**, **order systems**, and any workload where **data integrity** is paramount. Understanding **cost calculations** and **usage scenarios** will help you design resilient and highly reliable systems using DynamoDB.
