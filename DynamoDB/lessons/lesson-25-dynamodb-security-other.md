# **DynamoDB Security and Advanced Features**

This lecture covers important **DynamoDB security practices** and introduces **key features** that enhance the flexibility, security, and efficiency of your database applications.

---

## **Security in DynamoDB**

### **1. Private Access with VPC Endpoints**
- Use **VPC Endpoints** to access DynamoDB **without** traversing the public internet.
- **All traffic remains within your VPC**, improving security and minimizing exposure.

### **2. IAM-Based Access Control**
- **Access management** is fully controlled through **AWS IAM** (Identity and Access Management).
- Ensures **fine-grained and secure** authorization for users and services.

### **3. Encryption**
- **Encryption at Rest**:  
  - Managed through **AWS KMS (Key Management Service)**.
- **Encryption in Transit**:  
  - Implemented via **SSL/TLS** protocols to protect data during transmission.

## **Backup and Restore Features**

### **1. Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)**
- Similar to **RDS PITR**.
- Enables **continuous backups** with **no performance impact**.

### **2. Manual Backup and Restore**
- Take **on-demand backups** and **restore** them when necessary.

---

## **Global Tables**

- **Global Tables** provide a **multi-region, multi-active** setup.
- Tables are **fully replicated** across regions for **high availability** and **low-latency access**.
- **Enabling Steps:**
  - First, **enable DynamoDB Streams** to synchronize changes across regions.

---

## **Local Development: DynamoDB Local**

- **DynamoDB Local** allows you to run a **local version** of DynamoDB on your machine.
- **Benefits:**
  - Ideal for **development** and **testing** without consuming AWS resources.

---

## **Migrating Data to/from DynamoDB**

- Use the **AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)** to move data:
  - From **MongoDB**, **Oracle**, **MySQL**, **S3**, and other sources into DynamoDB.
  - Between DynamoDB instances if necessary.

---

## **Fine-Grained Access Control**

When **applications** (such as web or mobile apps) need to access DynamoDB directly, avoid assigning IAM users or roles directly. Instead, implement **fine-grained access** via **federated login**.

### **Federated Access with Temporary Credentials**
- Users authenticate via **Identity Providers** (IdPs) like:
  - **Amazon Cognito**, **Google**, **Facebook**, **OpenID Connect**, **SAML**, etc.
- After login, users receive **temporary AWS credentials**.

### **Securing Access with IAM Role Conditions**
- Assign users an **IAM role** with strict **conditions** based on their identity.
- Example of **fine-grained control**:
  - Policies allow actions like **GetItem**, **PutItem**, **Query**, **DeleteItem**, but **only** if conditions match.
  - **LeadingKey Condition**:  
    - Access is permitted **only** if the primary key matches the user’s identity.
  - **Attribute-Level Conditions**:  
    - Limit user access to **specific attributes** (columns) in the table.

### **Summary**
- Use **federated login** + **IAM role conditions** to secure:
  - **Row-level** (LeadingKey) and
  - **Column-level** (Attributes) access control.
